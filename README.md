## Contributing

### Contributing code

Try to use pull requests as much as possible, so we can keep the commit clutter to a minimum. For this, make a fork of the repository using the `Fork` button, and commit your changes to that. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for how to create a pull request from that fork.

When commiting, use `dart format` or `flutter format` to format your code, to keep it neat.

Always make sure that your code runs and works the way it should *before* you commit. Run any tests we may have. We don't want broken code.

Make sure your commit messages are descriptive enough to know what you did by just looking at it. You can read here on how to [write descriptive commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
